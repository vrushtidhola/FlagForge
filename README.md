# FlagForge
A distributed, production-grade feature flag and experimentation system inspired by platforms like LaunchDarkly, designed to support microservices, A/B testing, and gradual feature rollouts at scale.  This project demonstrates how modern companies safely release, experiment with users, and control system behavior without redeploying services.
